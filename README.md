# Predicting_employment_model
Simple model for predicting employment (numpy/LinearRegression)

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to forecast the number of employees for the upcoming month based on historical data.

Overview
The model uses employment data from the past six months (You can add more month) to predict the number of hires for month 7 (July) ex. of course. It applies a linear regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

Notes
This model assumes a linear relationship between time and employment numbers, which may not reflect real-world complexity.
For more accurate predictions, consider using more advanced models or incorporating additional variables (e.g., seasonality, economic indicators).
